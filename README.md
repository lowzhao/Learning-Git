# Learning Git in depth.

Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software developmentbut it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

### Requirements: 
__Download: [git](https://git-scm.com/)__ 

As cool as it seems, learning git for beginner can be as simple as possible. But for you to advance all the commands available in git, you will require alot of effort to master it.

If you never used command line interface before(... and didn't plan to learn anyways...) [Git Hub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) will be your best companion. And this [Git Cheat Sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf), can also be really useful.

Let's start simple.

So every command will start with `git *` something.

`*` will be the thing that we are discussing.

`[]` this will be the part where variable will be placed in, the words inside it will define what to put into.


## TLDR; (Your main 5 commands)
## `git clone [url]` 
> to __clone a repo__
## `git add .` >> `git commit -m "[message]"` >> `git push`
> to __push a commit__
## `git pull` 
> to __pull updates__
